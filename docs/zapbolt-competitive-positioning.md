## Messaging Framework

### Headline Options
1. "Feedback at lightning speed"
2. "See what your users see. Fix it faster."
3. "Bug reports with context. Finally."
4. "The feedback widget that actually helps."

### Value Props (3 Pillars)
1. **Fast Setup:** "Install in 5 minutes with one script tag"
2. **Visual Context:** "Screenshots and session replays included"
3. **Affordable:** "Free forever. Pro for $29/mo."

### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We use Intercom for feedback" | "Intercom is great for support. Zapbolt is built specifically for product feedback with visual context your support tool can't capture." |
| "We already have Hotjar" | "Hotjar is powerful but their feedback and replay are separate products ($171+/mo combined). Zapbolt unifies both for $29/mo." |
| "We're too small for this" | "Our free tier gives you 50 feedback submissions/month at no cost. Most startups don't need more than that to start." |
| "Security concerns with script injection" | "Our widget runs in an isolated Shadow DOM, loads async, and we're SOC2 compliant. We never access your users' data beyond what they explicitly submit." |
| "We need feature voting" | "Feature voting is on our roadmap for V2. For now, you can tag and filter feature requests in the dashboard—many teams find this sufficient." |
