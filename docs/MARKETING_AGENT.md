- 20% Behind-the-scenes (#buildinpublic)
- 10% Engagement with community

**Sample tweets:**
```
"It's broken" isn't a bug report.

That's why we built Zapbolt—screenshots and session replays attached to every submission.

Free tier. 5-minute setup. No enterprise sales call required.

→ zapbolt.io
```

```
Session replays changed how we fix bugs.

Instead of:
- "What browser?"
- "Can you reproduce?"
- "Send a screenshot?"

We just... watch what happened.

Now it's built into Zapbolt at $29/mo (not $200).
```

```
Shipped: URL pattern targeting 🎯

Now you can show the Zapbolt widget only on specific pages:
- /app/* → Show
- /checkout/* → Hide

Perfect for collecting feedback where it matters.
